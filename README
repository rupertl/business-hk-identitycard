NAME
    Business::HK::IdentityCard - validate identity card numbers used in Hong
    Kong

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        use Business::HK::IdentityCard;

        my $hkid = Business::HK::IdentityCard->new('A123456(3)');
        if ($hkid->is_valid())
        {
            print $hkid->as_string() . " is valid\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module validates identity card numbers used in Hong Kong. See
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Identity_Card> for further
    details on the format.

METHODS
  new
    Accepts a scalar representing the ID. IDs look like A123456(3), ie an
    alphabetic prefix, siz digits and a check digit. The prefix can be one
    or two characters and the brackets are optional for the check digit.

  is_valid
    Returns true if the ID provided is a correct HK ID. This will confirm
    that the format is correct and the checksum is valid.

  as_string
    Returns the ID formatted as a string using the conventional format, ie
    upper-case letters and checksum in brackets.

  as_string_no_checksum
    Returns the ID formatted as a string without the checksum. As the
    checksum is not officially part of the ID, some systems may store IDs in
    this format.

SOURCE AVAILABILITY
    Source code can be found on Github. Pull requests for bug fixes welcome.

THANKS
    Thanks to David Webb for advice on how the checksum for double prefix
    IDs should be calculated.
